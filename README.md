# Enhanced OCR Model
This repository contains the code for an enhanced OCR model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is designed to recognize both handwritten digits and letters with high accuracy, using data augmentation and effective callbacks to improve performance.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- *OCR.ipynb* Contains the Python code for the OCR model.

## Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- JSON
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. *Install the required libraries:*
